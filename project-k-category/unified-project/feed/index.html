<h6>The goal of this project is to automate the light conditions in a factory by turning off unnecessary lights and using the natural light sources when available. This will eventually reduce the electricity wastage. The system was developed using a microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, LDRs, and Servo–motors. Ultrasonic sensors are used to keep track of the number of people entering and leaving the room. LDRs used to gather information about the light intensity inside and outside of the room. The microcontroller processes the information collected from sensors and provides suitable outputs to lights and motors. According to the current state, servo motors are used to control blinds to receive natural light when it is available and necessary.</h6>

<h6>Today robotic arms are an essential part of human life. In our project, we developed a robotic arm that can be controlled through the Internet. We used a web application to get data from the user and send it through the Internet to a raspberry pi which controls the robotic arm. Our plan is to add a security cam to the arm and take real time videos from different angles for surveillance purposes.</h6>

<h6>The traditional approach of posting notices with paperwork in noticeboard is not attractive to read and also inefficient in searching. Therefore the idea of digital noticeboards is a high-value addition. Smart Noticeboard (SMARTICE) develops the idea further. It identifies the users using a face recognition algorithm, and select and display the notices only relevant to the user. SMARTICE reduces the time to search notices and it is fun to use.</h6>

<h6>This is a Virtual LED display using a set of LED strips which is rotating at a higher speed. It can show various things like texts, digits, images. This utilises 20 rapidly-spinning and pulsating LEDs. The inability of the human eye to capture these changing pulses is interpreted as a static image. The pattern of the LEDs is computed based on a string sent from an Android App through a very particular “alphabet” to the Arduino Mega controlling the LEDs. The user types the corresponding string on the Android App and sends to the device. The virtual LED display can be used at railway stations, shops, exhibitions and public places where a 360-degree view can give a nice experience.</h6>

<h6>We made a “Smart Piggy Bank”, an electronic coin saving device. Traditional Piggy Banks are used only to keep the money. But we include many features to make this a Smart Piggy Bank more closely not only to children but also to elders. When we insert a coin, it displays the total value of the coins inside the Piggy Bank. Also, it can show some text messages in an LCD to the user. These messages usually motivate the user to save money. As an additional feature, we added a guessing game that user is asked to guess the number of particular coins inside the Smart Piggy Bank. The piggy bank has two modes. The standard mode that sets the Piggy Bank as a currency counter or the game mode to have some fun with the Piggy Bank.</h6>

<h6>Up to date, Facebook has 5,000,000 monthly users for FarmVille which is a virtual farming game. According to the current trend people are so much interested in gaming as well as the fun of farming. Our aim is to make the farming experience realistic by maintaining a real farm and give access via a virtual interface. We developed a POC model for the proposed scenario. The player is to maintain a real farm which is owned by him. The game consists of three major parts. A farm, a robot and a video feedback. The game hosts can set up lands and rent the robots to the gamers. The robot is capable of doing ground making, planting and watering. The player can control the robot by looking through the video feedback received to their PC.</h6>

<h6>Taking medicine regularly has become a general practice and an essential activity in day-to-day life of most people. Even though it is advised that drug should regularly be taken, people always forget to take their medicine on time. Smart medicine box targeted on senior citizens who forget to take their medicine and the nurses who take care of senior citizens. This product informs the user the time by ringing an alarm and help the user by displaying the number of pills to be taken in front of the each box simplifying the process.</h6>

<h6>Today many have pets. However, due to their busy lifestyles, they can&#8217;t afford to be with the pet all the time and feed them. Sometimes they even have to be away from home for a few days. During such times, they cannot keep feeding their pet. Automatic pet feeders are developed to solve the particular problem. People can give food at any time in any amount using the pet feeder by controlling the device via the internet. A wifi server is used here to connect to the Internet. An indicator is used to check the food availability, a rotating disc with a stepper motor is used to control the food amount when supplying food, and a load cell is used to detect the remaining food in the plate.</h6>

<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study develops a remote monitoring diagnostic framework to detect condition of patients in real-time which helps avoiding potential diseases.This system will be basically used in hospitals and medical centers. The proposed system has an embedded microcontroller connected to a set of medical sensors (the sensors would differ according to the condition of the patient) and a wireless communication module (Bluetooth) . Each bed in the ward  is considered as a node in a wireless sensor network and connected to a central node installed at the main monitoring location in the ward through an internet connection. The embedded microcontroller checks if the patient health status is going well or not by analyzing the scanned medical signals. If even one of the sensing values goes out of the range, the monitoring system will indicate with an alarm that the particular patient is under a serious condition. If the condition is critical, then the system will automatically alarm the on-call doctor through a message. The medical report of each patient will be recorded separately and the overall details of each ward will be monitored by the hospital board. This system will be also helpful in reducing all the paperwork done at hospitals as the records of each patient by the time he gets checked in till time he gets discharged will be recorded. The following aspects will be addressed by the system mainly.</span></h6>
