<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caching is used as means to bridge the performance gap between processors and memory and multithreading is used to minimize the CPU idle time caused by the lower speeds of IO and memory tasks. However, when both these concepts are applied in a system, the total benefit of caching is not achieved due to the loss of cached data during context switches. As a solution, we propose to use thread specific caches, where the cache would be made of a group of small cache units and each thread is assigned a distinct cache core for its use.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last fifty years, the performance of computers evolved exponentially and continuously, closely following</span><b> Moores (1</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">). However, while microprocessor speed has been improving at roughly 60 percent per year, the memory access time has improved only by less than 10 p</span><b>ercent per year(2</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">). This performance gap between processor and memory has posed a threat to the exponential improvement of the overall </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">performance of computers. In order to bridge this CPU-Memory performance gap, and also to reduce the energy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consumption for memory accesses, cache memories are used.</span></h6>

The courses should be arranged to a set of timeslots satisfying hard and soft constraints. Manual creation of timetables is an expertise work also it consumes lot of time and human effort. To address all these problems, we introduce an automatic timetable generator which is a web application. The proposed system will take different inputs among lecturers, students and the others such as, number of students, lecture halls, lecturers, capacity of lecture halls, etc. Then it will create feasible timetable making excellent application of all resources which will be best suited for the constraints. In this research paper we will discuss how to automate the timetable scheduling process using Genetic algorithm which is a heuristic approach. Furthermore this paper deals with how to select the</span></h6>

<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are being widely used for sensing physical parameters in a broad geographical area. The person who needs WSN will only have a pictorial idea about how many sensor nodes are needed and what are they going to measure and how are they should be connected. The problem in the traditional method is that the person who needs the WSN should explain the pictorial view of the sensor network to a commercial vendor and buy it from them or they should design it from the scratch. What we proposed in our solution is that to create a platform so that the person who needs the WSN can directly draw the pictorial view on a canvas and then the platform will automatically generate all the required firmware</span></h6>
<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the microcontrollers and wiring diagrams. The user is required only to follow few instructions to complete the real world implementation of the WSN. So basically this project is about developing a visual platform to design WSN. The WSN designing platform was built as a web application, so it can</span></h6>
<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">manage a large number of supported sensors and microcontrollers, which means if one user adds the device driver for any a sensor or a microcontroller the rest of the world can directly use it from the platform without worrying about the hardware programming. Also if anyone needs a new sensor or microcontroller to be supported by this visual design platform, this will have interfaces to directly add new sensors and microcontrollers. Also, the designers will be able to switch the networking technology as per the requirement. This method is affordable to develop custom wireless sensor networks and increase the productivity, health, and economy accordingly.</span></h6>

<h6>Traditionally farmers are the lifeline of a country who contributes to the economy immensely. However, in Sri Lanka, they are unable to receive a sufficient income by selling their harvest. Sometimes they are unable to cover even the cost. The aim of this research is to provide a solution to farmers enabling them to obtain a competitive price for their produce. Though the farming process has several stages, selecting a crop for cultivating in a given season and selling the harvest are important stages which contribute to the profitability. Therefore it was decided to develop a social media-based web application to facilitate the linking of the optimum set of buyers to farmers maximizing the benefits for both parties while minimizing intermediate buyers and sellers. In the developed system there are three main subsystems namely bidding system, transport optimizing and question and answering system. By using these three subsystems it is proposed to provide a solution for not receiving a reasonable income to the farmers. Since this problem forces farmers to quit farming, by introducing this application, it is expected to retain the farmers by making the farming a profit-making enterprise</h6>

<h6>This paper is about the Swarm Robotics research that is still going on. First, an introduction into the Swarm Robotics and Swarm Intelligence is given and the current status of the research that is found in the field of Swarm Robotics is explained. Moreover, related work in the field of Swarm Robotics is also discussed. Then, problems that are found and our approach to solve a few of those problems are discussed. Next, the methodology that was used and a few experiments that were done are explained. Thereafter, it contains the results analysis and the findings of this project. Finally, the conclusions and future work are discussed. Swarm Robotics is basically a swarm of robots working together collaboratively to perform a simple task. Swarm Intelligence is one of the main techniques used in Swarm Robotics. Swarm Intelligence is seemingly unintelligent robot units working together to achieve a common goal in a way that it appears they have an intelligence of their own. Applying Swarm Intelligence into a robot system gave the rise to the idea of Swarm Robotics. There are many use cases for swarm robotics ranging from education robots to life rescuing robots in cases of emergency.There are even swarms of robots in the air too</h6>

<h6>The purpose of this study is to come up with a software tool capable of supporting in resolving issues with binaries (dependencies of binaries) which share Portable Executable File Format and also to be used as an inspection tool to view the information contained in such a file. The tool to supports files of format.DLL and.EXE and is packed with a graphical user interface that makes the tool very user-friendly so that even a nontech savvy person can operate the tool. Apart from the user experience, it provides all the information a Portable Executable inspection tool is supposed to provide. Although there are lots of alternative tools present in this domain none of them provides all the essential features which are needed to inspect and resolve dependency issues. In addition to the usual features like displaying dependency trees, import-export mismatches detection, circular dependency detection this tool has unique features that it supports reverse dependency detection, provides smart suggestions and supports 32-bit 64-bit and .NET portable executables all in a single tool.</h6>

<h6>Most of the countries around the world has at least a single unit to protect the country from any outside attackers, natural disasters or any other threats that requires the support of a well-trained, intelligent group of people. Such groups can be infantry forces, naval forces, air forces or other humanitarian assistance forces. In front of such destructivesituations  these forces have to gather intelligence on the location, enemy, weather, vegetation, infrastructure and many more before making decisions. Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield is the name given for that process of analyzing the situation and making decisions based on predictions. So this report is focused on the very first phase of Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield, Battlefield Area Evaluation. This report presents detailed information on the background research on Automated Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield, the proposed solution which is based on Geographical Information Systems (GIS), algorithm that used to obtain the areas where enemy and friendly forces can go and cannot go, implementation details</h6>
