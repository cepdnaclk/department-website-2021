<p>The Team IT Crowd consisted of Sandun Kodagoda,Adithya Gallage and Denuka  Jayaweera, undergraduates of Department computer Engineering became champions in the  YES hub boot camp &#8217;21 organized by the Yes Hub, Venture Frontier along with the US  Embassy.</p>



<p><br> This Entrepreneurial , Innovation and Pitching event had around 50 teams participating in  the event after a preliminary qualification held offline. The competitors participated in the  competition ranged from MSc Holders to Undergraduates. after the first round the team IT Crowd got selected to Top Six and after the second round they eventually went on to win the<br> completion. The Event was graced by more than 15 national and international entrepreneurs  businessmen who appreciated the effort thrown in by the team. </p>



<p><br> The Idea Pitched by the Team IT crowd started as their second year project in the university which is about developing the concept of smart lockers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Three third <sup>&nbsp;</sup>year undergraduates from the University of Peradeniya have invented a hundred percent Bio-Degradable Sanitizer bottle and Sanitary wipe package to combat this issue. Navodya&nbsp; Kumari Ekanayake, a third-year medical student; Shakthi Senarathne, a third-year medical student; Denuka Jayaweera, a third-year engineering undergraduate from the Department of Computer Engineering are working on this team CLOUD ATLAS.</p>



<p>Their aims are to make an impact on environmental conservation, to contribute towards United Nations Sustainable development goals three six nine and twelve, to give a sustainable alternative for sanitary needs in the market, to reduce the usage of polythene and plastics and to take a value out of banana stem which is thrown away after harvesting.</p>



<p>Plastic usage has been abused and adulterated by mankind, stepping towards the highest risks of pollution. The net increment of usage hasnâ€™t been calculated for the year 2020, but undoubtedly an exponential rise can be predicted. Disposal and the 3R method seems to be in the air, but plastic landfill is the commonest problem well known, but solutions are not yet properly addressed by any responsible authority.</p>



<p>Due
to the covid pandemic, the usage of sanitiser bottles increased drastically. If
five million [which is less than twenty-five percent of the population] people
discard one sanitiser bottle each per two weeks, the number of sanitiser
bottles discarded per month is approximately ten million bottles. If so the
total amount of plastic landfill added by sanitiser bottles per month equals
the total number of bottles discarded into the mean weight of one bottle which
eventually add up to around three hundred thousand kilograms of plastics per
month only by sanitiser bottles.</p>



<p>They
figured out this directly affected the usage of polythene and plastic in Sri
Lanka. And to add to that normal bottle of sanitiser takes about four hundred
and fifty to six hundred years to get decomposed, other than that there was no
such biodegradable product in the market similar to this not only in Sri Lanka
but in the global context as well.</p>



<p>The
prototyped product was the first bottle model and sanitary wipe in the world,
to be made out of a banana stem as the main ingredient. All these products have
a net zero percent environmental impact, Which decomposes completely within one
month. They chose banana paper over normal recycled paper, to address this
environmental impact issue. Even recycled paper demands an additional cost of
cutting trees, which is harmful to the prevailing situation of the country.
They have aimed at minimal deforestation and carbon footprint in the production
process.</p>



<p>Recently,
bamboo came as a substitute for normal trees in China and East Asian countries.
But in countries like Sri Lanka, bamboo cannot be used as a substitute
ingredient for paper, as we don&#8217;t have considerable bamboo cultivation
targeting production. Bamboo is highly resilient against soil erosion,
especially in river beds. Banana has the same properties found in bamboo and is
easily found in Sri Lanka. Add to that the fineness of a banana is better than
bamboo (with an average fineness of two thousand four hundred Nano meters).
Worldwide there is a good market for bamboo wipes due to their softness.
Therefore banana would be better</p>



<p>The team emerged as the ideation champions in Thinkwave 2.0 organized by the University of Moratuwa, Overall runners up in Thinkwave 2.0, champions of Pera Inventra 2021 and second runners up of YES Youth Entrepreneurship Summit organized by the University of Sri Jayawaradenapura. </p>



<p>Their work has also being featured in local newspaper.</p>

<p>The team Data Crunchers, a&nbsp; group of students from the Department of Computer Engineering was able to emerge as the 2nd runners up at Data Storm v1.0 which was organized by the Rotaract clubs of University of Moratuwa and University of&nbsp; Colombo and held on the 29th of February 2020 at the John Keells Holdings Auditorium. The team consisted of Imesh Ekanayake(E15), Heshan Dissanayake (E16) and Hiruna Samarakoon(E14). 21 teams have been filtered out from an initial selection round where 103 teams competed in an online kaggle platform. The teams were selected to the final round based on the performance on the kaggle platform and a detailed report submitted on their techniques.</p>



<p>At the final round, the participants have been given a task of predicting churning customers of keels supermarket chains. The team DataCrunches has been able to achieve a training accuracy of 88% and testing accuracy of 83% by combining different techniques with an ensemble method.<br></p>



<p>Team Testing 123 consisting of Chamara Gunarathne, Shehan Perera and Prabhath Bandara has also been qualified for the final round of the same competition.</p>



<p>The department congratulates both the teams on this achievements.</p>

<p>Team CrunchCode was able to emerge as the 2nd runners up at Brainstorm 2019, Sri Lanka&#8217;s Premier Biomedical Engineering Design Competition, organized by the IEEE EMBS Student Branch Chapter at University of Moratuwa. The team which consisted of Hiruna Samarakoon, Anjana Senanayaka, Sanoj Punchihewa of the Faculty of Engineering, Sachith Keragala from the Faculty of Medicine and Hasindu Gamarachchi from University of New South Wales, Australia as the mentor was recognized as the 2nd runners up for their project of a portable real-time DNA analysis toolkit. Their toolkit along with the server that manages devices that run the toolkit enables simultaneous sequencing and analysis of DNA reads. DNA reads can be analyzed for DNA methylation, event alignment and for intermediate tasks like reads alignment, sorting, and indexing. The competition was held on the 7th of December 2019 at the IESL Auditorium.<br> Among the top 10 were two other teams from the Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya, the team testing123 that consists of Kaveesha Dilshani, Chamara Gunarathne, and Shehan Perera from the final year and team Genesis 1.0 of&nbsp;Avishka Dhananjaya, Prageeth Savinda and Sewwandie Nanayakkara from the 3rd year.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
