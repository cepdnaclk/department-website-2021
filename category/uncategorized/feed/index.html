								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We warmly congratulate Gihan Jayathilake, from the Department of Computer Engineering for winning the best artifact award at &nbsp;the International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN) &nbsp;2021 conference for his work on “Deeplight”. IPSN is a leading annual forum on research in networked sensing and control, broadly defined.</p>



<p>A paper
co-authored by Gihan, titled “DeepLight: Robust &amp; Unobtrusive Real-time
Screen-Camera Communication for Real-World Displays” was accepted for IPSN 2021
(ACM/IEEE International Conference of Information Processing in Sensor
Networks) which was held during 18-21 May 2021 in Nashville,&nbsp;Tennessee,
USA. The conference had 105 submissions from all around the world and a 24%
acceptance rate.</p>



<p>The team won the
best artifact award at the conference. The award was introduced last year to
encourage sharing of code/data and to promote the credibility of the
community’s work. The evaluation criteria are (a) how well presented the code
is and (2) the impact/potential of the contribution to the community/society.</p>



<p>Deeplight is a
novel screen-to-camera communication (SCC) system developed to enable
real-world&nbsp;situations. The generic idea of such systems is to encode
messages in computer screens to be decoded by a camera system. The basic task
is to make these encodings imperceptible (so a human using the screen would not
be disturbed by the messages being transmitted for the camera). The task
becomes non-trivial because the image processing algorithm has to be able to
decode the imperceptible encoding. A wide range of algorithm and system design
challenges are detailed in the publication.</p>



<p><br>
This project was done by Vu Tran (when he was a PhD student/postdoc in
Singapore Management University) and Gihan Jayatilaka (when he was an intern at
SMU and a final year undergraduate in the University of Peradeniya) under the
supervision of their advisers Prof. Ashwin Ashok (Georgia State University) and
Prof. Archan Misra (Singapore Management University).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are delighted to announce that two projects presented by two of the students from our department, Keshara Weerasinghe and Viraj Dhanushka, have been awarded &#8220;Best product/project &#8211; University Category &#8211; Central Province&#8221; at the SLASSCOM NATIONAL INGENUITY AWARDS 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We Congratulate Keshara Weerasinghe and Viraj Dhanushka for the recognition they have achieved. We are indeed proud of the extra step they have taken in representing the Department of Computer Engineering University of Peradeniya on such a national platform.<br></p>



<p>Keshara Weerasinghe has presented the Real-time Remote Covid-19 Patient Monitoring System built by himself and Kasun Vithanage (also from the Department of Computer Engineering) for the contest. This project was initiated as a solution for the huge risk the Medical professionals take in examining the COVID19 patients under isolation. We are proud of the effort taken by the two students in contributing from the best of their capabilities to the country during the hour of need. The Monitoring System built is currently functioning in National Hospital Kandy and Teaching Hospital Peradeniya.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Viraj Dhanushka has presented the project titled, Digital Signage Based User Targeted Advertising. Here, they have embedded a user detecting and identifying unit within the digital signage system so that when a user is in front of a digital screen, the items advertised on the screen are relevant to the particular user. They have also implemented a digital signage control unit and a smart power supply unit in making the system more affordable and effective. This was built by Viraj Dhanushka, Hans Thisanke, Sumudu Liyanage from the Department of Computer Engineering, Ashan Serasinghe from the department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and Akitha Madusanga from the Department of Civil Engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We once again congratulate Keshara Weerasinghe and Viraj Dhanushka for being innovative, going the extra mile in applying for national-level contests, and being an inspiration to other students.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Coronavirus (COVID-19)&nbsp; pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time. Since its emergence late last year, the virus has now spread around the world including Sri Lanka.</p>



<p>In hospitals, doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers are fighting a prolonged battle against this deadly and highly contagious illness.<br></p>



<p>When&nbsp; COVID-19 patients are isolated medical workers have to go around the isolation wards to check vital signs of patients from time to time. They have to put on protective gear for this task. Here they are putting themselves at a huge risk since the virus can be infected even from a very small mistake.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Keshara Weerasinghe and Kasun Vithanage,&nbsp; undergraduates from the Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya have designed and implemented a Real-time Remote COVID-19 Patient Vital Monitoring System for isolation wards. While the medical care front liners are putting their lives on danger every minute, Kasun and Keshara have paired up to bring their engineering knowledge into practice to make a product that is extremely useful in this time of crisis. Not only were they able to develop it as a complete product, but they also have installed it at Teaching Hospital Peradeniya. This method is effective and safer since it reduces unnecessary contact between patients and the staff.<br></p>



<p>Heart Rate, SpO2, ECG, Respiratory Rate, Body Temperature, Non-Invasive Blood Pressure of the patient are some of the readings that can be monitored by this system. It has a&nbsp; priority-based alarm service that alarms the staff on any critical condition. They are hoping to develop this further by adding real-time analytics, AI to make it a fully featured patient vital monitoring system.<br></p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, these real-time patient monitoring systems are imported by foreign countries and they usually cost a heavy amount which is hard to be afforded by a developing country like Sri Lanka. With the system implemented by Keshara and Kasun, they believe the same functionalities can be implemented and tested within the hospitals of Sri Lanka at a minimal cost.<br></p>



<p>Hard work, dedication, and using their knowledge, skills, and building something that can make the world better and save people’s lives in the time of need is the highest one can expect from a university undergraduate.&nbsp; Keshara and Kasun did their best to support our frontline in the battle against this virus.<br></p>



<p>Kasun and Keshara’s project has set up an example for all the undergraduates of the country to realize what they are capable of. They have shown that with good motive and proper commitment, they could help each other and help to provide solutions for any difficult solution without relying only on the facilities one could get.<br></p>



<p>They are especially thankful to the lecturers of the Department of Computer Engineering for their guidance, support, and encouragement. They are also grateful for the support given by&nbsp; &nbsp;Doctor <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sudarshana.wickramasinghe?__tn__=KH-R&amp;eid=ARCXEL8nGtCDNb1sviMYF-d_hm1d42-Xlt0CiFtljbcT2blSx1Z92YKw0L3fXJ-hw2PRT1CYseEQd6-g&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBnsc1Cc6CJS8mAMOSgfggx90GWicF47ctx2xZMPOD-UXmTQzg4Eyk3LuTBmKq4b9qUhCnIIrG1M7CbVHBWiS0f3D-qS02w76IopXUK8P7JBFXOIi91uBkG9lCIhe2t6WUAPKqxLiZaVzLcwKVLlVfx4V-FIOMjv_LLSRLzwugiOUGoxYumExEJS0qw5QMycoASUyquPI11znINS3_t-1ezdudBHls5BoJcf2g7Qfv_okz2nipIl3k9O6QXkBgydBIVIvG6u_vdYK8T1f252tML644ziyM">Sudarshana Wickramasinghe</a> and others who helped them immensely with medical guidance and support.</p>
