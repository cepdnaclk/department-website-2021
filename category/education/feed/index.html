president, Mr. Malitha Liyanage commenced the meeting by welcoming all the
members and sharing a few memories of the events conducted during the past
year. After presenting the meeting minutes of the last annual general meeting and
the budget report for the last year by the secretary, Mr. Hashan Eranga, and
the junior treasurer, Mr. Nipun Dewanarayane, the new office bearers of ACES
for the term 2021/22 were appointed. </p>



<p>Accordingly, Mr. Randika Viraj was
appointed as the President for the new term. Next up was the appointment for
the role of Vice President and Mr. Thushara Weerasundara was appointed for it.
Subsequently, Mr. Imesh Balasuriya and Mr. Ridma Jayasundara were appointed for
the roles of Secretary and Assistant Secretary respectively. Afterwards, Dr.
Isuru Nawinne, a Senior Lecturer of the department, was assigned as the Senior
Treasurer followed by the appointment of Mr. Nadeesha Diwakara as the Junior
Treasurer. Then, Miss Nanduni Gamage and Miss Isara Tillekaratne were appointed
for the roles of Editor and Junior Editor respectively. Finally, eight
committee members were assigned representing the batches E16, E17, and E18 as

online events and that ACES could be at the forefront of organizing such events
with novel concepts. It was highlighted that having two plans for the online
mode as well as the physical mode could be beneficial to overcome the
uncertainties and the AGM marked the conclusion with a bunch of
experience-based advice and great congratulations to the new committee for the
upcoming year. </p>

<p>Team CrunchCode was able to emerge as the 2nd runners up at Brainstorm 2019, Sri Lanka&#8217;s Premier Biomedical Engineering Design Competition, organized by the IEEE EMBS Student Branch Chapter at University of Moratuwa. The team which consisted of Hiruna Samarakoon, Anjana Senanayaka, Sanoj Punchihewa of the Faculty of Engineering, Sachith Keragala from the Faculty of Medicine and Hasindu Gamarachchi from University of New South Wales, Australia as the mentor was recognized as the 2nd runners up for their project of a portable real-time DNA analysis toolkit. Their toolkit along with the server that manages devices that run the toolkit enables simultaneous sequencing and analysis of DNA reads. DNA reads can be analyzed for DNA methylation, event alignment and for intermediate tasks like reads alignment, sorting, and indexing. The competition was held on the 7th of December 2019 at the IESL Auditorium.<br> Among the top 10 were two other teams from the Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya, the team testing123 that consists of Kaveesha Dilshani, Chamara Gunarathne, and Shehan Perera from the final year and team Genesis 1.0 of&nbsp;Avishka Dhananjaya, Prageeth Savinda and Sewwandie Nanayakkara from the 3rd year.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
