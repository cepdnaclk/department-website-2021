<p>The annual general meeting of the
Association of Computer Engineering Students (ACES) was successfully held on
28th October 2021 with the participation of students and lecturers of the
department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya. The outgoing
president, Mr. Malitha Liyanage commenced the meeting by welcoming all the
members and sharing a few memories of the events conducted during the past
year. After presenting the meeting minutes of the last annual general meeting and
the budget report for the last year by the secretary, Mr. Hashan Eranga, and
the junior treasurer, Mr. Nipun Dewanarayane, the new office bearers of ACES
for the term 2021/22 were appointed. </p>



<p>Accordingly, Mr. Randika Viraj was
appointed as the President for the new term. Next up was the appointment for
the role of Vice President and Mr. Thushara Weerasundara was appointed for it.
Subsequently, Mr. Imesh Balasuriya and Mr. Ridma Jayasundara were appointed for
the roles of Secretary and Assistant Secretary respectively. Afterwards, Dr.
Isuru Nawinne, a Senior Lecturer of the department, was assigned as the Senior
Treasurer followed by the appointment of Mr. Nadeesha Diwakara as the Junior
Treasurer. Then, Miss Nanduni Gamage and Miss Isara Tillekaratne were appointed
for the roles of Editor and Junior Editor respectively. Finally, eight
committee members were assigned representing the batches E16, E17, and E18 as
follows; Mr. Kavindu Hewamanage, Mr. Deshan Liyanaarachchi, and Mr. Heshan
Dissanayake, representing the E16 batch, Mr. Pubudu Bandara and Mr. Adithya
Gallage representing the E17 batch and Mr. Ishta Jayakody, Miss Roshila
Sewwandi and Mr. Ruchira Tharaka, representing the E18 batch. </p>



<p>After appointing the new members, Mr.
Randika, the newly appointed president took a few moments to thank the past
committee for their hard work. Also, he further added a brief introduction to
the upcoming plans and asked for any opinions and suggestions regarding this endeavor.
The latter part of the meeting comprised a discussion among the staff members
and the students on the suggestions for the upcoming year. Prof. Roshan Ragel
expressed his idea that the pandemic situation has brought forth the need for
online events and that ACES could be at the forefront of organizing such events
with novel concepts. It was highlighted that having two plans for the online
mode as well as the physical mode could be beneficial to overcome the
uncertainties and the AGM marked the conclusion with a bunch of
experience-based advice and great congratulations to the new committee for the
upcoming year. </p>



<p>ACES is looking forward to bring more creative and productive programs in the coming year and invites everyone to stay tuned.</p>

The team emerged as the ideation champions in Thinkwave 2.0 organized by the University of Moratuwa, Overall runners up in Thinkwave 2.0, champions of Pera Inventra 2021 and second runners up of YES Youth Entrepreneurship Summit organized by the University of Sri Jayawaradenapura. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Three third <sup>&nbsp;</sup>year undergraduates from the University of Peradeniya have invented a hundred percent Bio-Degradable Sanitizer bottle and Sanitary wipe package to combat this issue. Navodya&nbsp; Kumari Ekanayake, a third-year medical student; Shakthi Senarathne, a third-year medical student; Denuka Jayaweera, a third-year engineering undergraduate from the Department of Computer Engineering are working on this team CLOUD ATLAS.</p>



<p>Their aims are to make an impact on environmental conservation, to contribute towards United Nations Sustainable development goals three six nine and twelve, to give a sustainable alternative for sanitary needs in the market, to reduce the usage of polythene and plastics and to take a value out of banana stem which is thrown away after harvesting.</p>



<p>Plastic usage has been abused and adulterated by mankind, stepping towards the highest risks of pollution. The net increment of usage hasn’t been calculated for the year 2020, but undoubtedly an exponential rise can be predicted. Disposal and the 3R method seems to be in the air, but plastic landfill is the commonest problem well known, but solutions are not yet properly addressed by any responsible authority.</p>



<p>Due
to the covid pandemic, the usage of sanitiser bottles increased drastically. If
five million [which is less than twenty-five percent of the population] people
discard one sanitiser bottle each per two weeks, the number of sanitiser
bottles discarded per month is approximately ten million bottles. If so the
total amount of plastic landfill added by sanitiser bottles per month equals
the total number of bottles discarded into the mean weight of one bottle which
eventually add up to around three hundred thousand kilograms of plastics per
month only by sanitiser bottles.</p>



<p>They
figured out this directly affected the usage of polythene and plastic in Sri
Lanka. And to add to that normal bottle of sanitiser takes about four hundred
and fifty to six hundred years to get decomposed, other than that there was no
such biodegradable product in the market similar to this not only in Sri Lanka
but in the global context as well.</p>



<p>The
prototyped product was the first bottle model and sanitary wipe in the world,
to be made out of a banana stem as the main ingredient. All these products have
a net zero percent environmental impact, Which decomposes completely within one
month. They chose banana paper over normal recycled paper, to address this
environmental impact issue. Even recycled paper demands an additional cost of
cutting trees, which is harmful to the prevailing situation of the country.
They have aimed at minimal deforestation and carbon footprint in the production
process.</p>



<p>Recently,
bamboo came as a substitute for normal trees in China and East Asian countries.
But in countries like Sri Lanka, bamboo cannot be used as a substitute
ingredient for paper, as we don&#8217;t have considerable bamboo cultivation
targeting production. Bamboo is highly resilient against soil erosion,
especially in river beds. Banana has the same properties found in bamboo and is
easily found in Sri Lanka. Add to that the fineness of a banana is better than
bamboo (with an average fineness of two thousand four hundred Nano meters).
Worldwide there is a good market for bamboo wipes due to their softness.
Therefore banana would be better</p>



<p>The team emerged as the ideation champions in Thinkwave 2.0 organized by the University of Moratuwa, Overall runners up in Thinkwave 2.0, champions of Pera Inventra 2021 and second runners up of YES Youth Entrepreneurship Summit organized by the University of Sri Jayawaradenapura. </p>



<p>Their work has also being featured in local newspaper.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We warmly congratulate Gihan Jayathilake, a recent alumni of the department from E/14 batch for winning the best artifact award at IPSN 2021 conference for his work on "Deeplight"]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We warmly congratulate Gihan Jayathilake, from the Department of Computer Engineering for winning the best artifact award at &nbsp;the International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN) &nbsp;2021 conference for his work on “Deeplight”. IPSN is a leading annual forum on research in networked sensing and control, broadly defined.</p>



<p>A paper
co-authored by Gihan, titled “DeepLight: Robust &amp; Unobtrusive Real-time
Screen-Camera Communication for Real-World Displays” was accepted for IPSN 2021
(ACM/IEEE International Conference of Information Processing in Sensor
Networks) which was held during 18-21 May 2021 in Nashville,&nbsp;Tennessee,
USA. The conference had 105 submissions from all around the world and a 24%
acceptance rate.</p>



<p>The team won the
best artifact award at the conference. The award was introduced last year to
encourage sharing of code/data and to promote the credibility of the
community’s work. The evaluation criteria are (a) how well presented the code
is and (2) the impact/potential of the contribution to the community/society.</p>



<p>Deeplight is a
novel screen-to-camera communication (SCC) system developed to enable
real-world&nbsp;situations. The generic idea of such systems is to encode
messages in computer screens to be decoded by a camera system. The basic task
is to make these encodings imperceptible (so a human using the screen would not
be disturbed by the messages being transmitted for the camera). The task
becomes non-trivial because the image processing algorithm has to be able to
decode the imperceptible encoding. A wide range of algorithm and system design
challenges are detailed in the publication.</p>



<p><br>
This project was done by Vu Tran (when he was a PhD student/postdoc in
Singapore Management University) and Gihan Jayatilaka (when he was an intern at
SMU and a final year undergraduate in the University of Peradeniya) under the
supervision of their advisers Prof. Ashwin Ashok (Georgia State University) and
Prof. Archan Misra (Singapore Management University).</p>

<p>Keshara Weerasinghe has presented the Real-time Remote Covid-19 Patient Monitoring System built by himself and Kasun Vithanage (also from the Department of Computer Engineering) for the contest. This project was initiated as a solution for the huge risk the Medical professionals take in examining the COVID19 patients under isolation. We are proud of the effort taken by the two students in contributing from the best of their capabilities to the country during the hour of need. The Monitoring System built is currently functioning in National Hospital Kandy and Teaching Hospital Peradeniya.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Viraj Dhanushka has presented the project titled, Digital Signage Based User Targeted Advertising. Here, they have embedded a user detecting and identifying unit within the digital signage system so that when a user is in front of a digital screen, the items advertised on the screen are relevant to the particular user. They have also implemented a digital signage control unit and a smart power supply unit in making the system more affordable and effective. This was built by Viraj Dhanushka, Hans Thisanke, Sumudu Liyanage from the Department of Computer Engineering, Ashan Serasinghe from the department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and Akitha Madusanga from the Department of Civil Engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We once again congratulate Keshara Weerasinghe and Viraj Dhanushka for being innovative, going the extra mile in applying for national-level contests, and being an inspiration to other students.<br></p>
